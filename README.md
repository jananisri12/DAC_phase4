Project Name: Water Quality Data Analysis System

Project Description:

This project aims to develop a comprehensive water quality data analysis system that can be used to assess potability, identify deviations from standards, and understand parameter relationships. The system will be easy to use and provide stakeholders with actionable insights to improve water quality management and public health.

System Components:

The system will include the following components:

Visualization strategy: The visualization strategy will use histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize the distribution of each parameter, correlations between parameters, and relationships between parameters and water potability. The visualizations will be interactive to allow users to explore the data in more detail. Machine learning model: The machine learning model will use a random forest algorithm to predict water potability based on the key parameters (pH, hardness, and solids). Project Goals:

The goals of this project are to:

Develop a visualization strategy that is easy to understand and use. Develop a predictive model that is accurate and reliable. Use the analysis to provide stakeholders with actionable insights to improve water quality management and public health.
